# Disclaimer!

Proceed with caution! Many steps in a battery build could lead to injury fire or even explosions especially when dealing with rechargable cells.

Do so at your own risk, I take no responsibility or liability for your own actions, this guide is informational only.

If you want to learn how to assamble a battery pack safely, I will have a course for you in a few months.

# Prerequisites:

· You know the form factor of the battery you are going to build.
· You have an account to acces Fusion360 Online or desktop version.
